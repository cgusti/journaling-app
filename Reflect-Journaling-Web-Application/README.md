# Reflect

Reflect is a Journaling Web Application aimed to give users a platform to journal wherever they go. All one simply needs is a google account to log in, and they can start journaling within the applications UI. Users can create new journal entries complete with Titles and the date they were created, and use the navigation bar to reflect on past journal entries, or go back to make modifications if they wish. The entire app was developed with React for the front-end and Google Firestore for the backend. While I developed the app myself, I received guidance from my Web App Development professor Dr. Toal, as well as a couple classmates in order to share ideas/coding techniques.
